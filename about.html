                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    With a strong foundation in data analytics and business communication skills developed through my time at Price College,  
                    I am well equipped to tackle the complex challenges facing our nation today and in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through my leadership roles in on campus in organizations including Sigma Nu Fraternity, as well as with the Marine Corps,
                    I have honed my leadership and communication skills.
                    These skills enable me to effectively collaborate with all types of people, each with unique strengths,
                    to achieve common goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time as a server at the Stonebriar Country Club, I was exposed to a diverse group of people,
                    from coworkers to customers, in a high speed environment. 
                    This invaluable experience, combined with my time with the Marines and at The University of Oklahoma,
                    I have become not only an effective team member, but an effective leader.
